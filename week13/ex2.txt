Advantage of deadlock avoidance over recovery that 
deadlock recovery need all resources but systems request resources one at a time. 
In that case deadlock avoidance is more preferable

Advantage of deadlock prevention over deadlock avoidance that
deadlock avoidance uses algorithm which in general useless, because it need information about maximum of resources.
So, for avoiding of such situation deadlock prevention can be used, because it just block any condition of deadlock
