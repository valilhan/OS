Recovery:
recovery is functional if it's appicable  to :
1- kill the process or 
2- preempt it's resources.
 How ever we are not allowed to use it in RT-systems or batch systems.

*Prevention:
The best strategy if the requests from processes are given.
Besides, the problem of planning is decidable. 
---------
*Avoiding is good when new requests of resources requires dynamic decisions 
that doesn't result in deadlocks. for this method, Banker's algorithm is usually used.
This approach is a good mean for interactive systems.
